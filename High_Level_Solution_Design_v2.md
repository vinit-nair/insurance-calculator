## 🎯 PROBLEM STATEMENT & MARKET OPPORTUNITY

### Current Market Pain Points
1. **Opacity Crisis**: 73% of UK consumers don't understand how their life insurance needs are calculated
2. **One-Size-Fits-All**: Generic multipliers (e.g., "10x salary") ignore individual circumstances
3. **Inflation Blindness**: Most calculators ignore inflation impact on long-term needs
4. **Regulatory Gaps**: Many tools don't align with FCA transparency requirements
5. **Trust Deficit**: Complex calculations without clear explanations reduce customer confidence

### Market Opportunity
- **£67 billion** UK life insurance market (2024)
- **12 million** under-insured UK households
- **£2.4 trillion** protection gap in UK life insurance
- **85%** of customers want transparent calculation explanations
- **Growing demand** for digital-first insurance solutions

## 🧮 ACTUARIAL METHODOLOGY

### Four-Method Calculation Framework

#### 1. Income Replacement Method
**Purpose**: UK standard approach for salary-based coverage
**Formula**: `Annual Income × Age-Adjusted Multiplier (8-12 years)`
**UK Compliance**: Follows ABI guidelines for income multiples

```
Base Multiplier: 10 years
Adjustments:
• Age < 35: +1 (longer earning potential)
• Age > 55: -1 (shorter earning period)
• Dependents > 2: +1 (higher family needs)
• No dependents: -1 (reduced obligations)
```

#### 2. DIME Method (Comprehensive Obligations)
**Purpose**: Systematic coverage of major financial obligations
**Components**: Debt + Income + Mortgage + Education
**UK Adaptation**: Incorporates UK education costs and mortgage structures

```
• Debt: All non-mortgage obligations
• Income: 10 years net income replacement
• Mortgage: Outstanding balance
• Education: UK university costs (£27k tuition + £15k living × 3 years)
```

#### 3. Needs-Based Analysis
**Purpose**: Detailed family expense calculation
**Approach**: Comprehensive living cost assessment
**UK Specificity**: Uses ONS household expenditure data

```
• Living Expenses: Monthly expenses × Years of support
• Immediate Needs: Funeral costs + 6 months emergency fund
• Long-term Obligations: Mortgage + debts + education
• Support Period: Age-dependent calculation (until retirement/independence)
```

#### 4. Human Life Value Method
**Purpose**: Economic value assessment using present value
**Calculation**: NPV of future earnings at 3% discount rate
**UK Standards**: Uses Bank of England base rate + inflation expectations

```
Present Value = Σ(Net Annual Income ÷ (1.03)^n) for n=1 to working years
Working Years = 65 - Current Age
Net Income = Gross Income - Spouse Income
```

### **INNOVATION: Dynamic Inflation Protection**

#### Coverage Amount Adjustment
- **Without Inflation Protection**: Coverage = Median of four methods
- **With Inflation Protection**: Coverage = Median × 1.15 (15% increase)
- **Rationale**: Higher initial coverage accounts for growing financial needs over policy period

#### Premium Calculation Enhancement
- **Base Premium**: 0.12% of coverage (ABI 2024 data)
- **Sequential Adjustments**: Age → Gender → Smoking → Term → **Inflation Protection**
- **Inflation Factor**: 1.22× multiplier (22% increase for RPI-linked policies)

#### UK Regulatory Compliance
- **FCA Alignment**: Transparent methodology without arbitrary weightings
- **Professional Standards**: Follows Institute of Actuaries guidance
- **Customer Fairness**: Clear explanation of all adjustments
