# UK Life Insurance Calculator - Methods Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive documentation of all four calculation methods used in the UK Life Insurance Calculator, including their UK standards compliance, multipliers, and external references for transparency and accuracy.

## 1. INCOME REPLACEMENT METHOD

### **Purpose**
UK standard approach for salary-based coverage calculation, following Association of British Insurers (ABI) guidelines.

### **Formula**
```
Coverage = Annual Income × Age-Adjusted Multiplier
```

### **Multiplier Logic**
- **Base Multiplier**: 10 years
- **Age Adjustments**:
  - Age < 35: +1 (longer earning potential)
  - Age > 55: -1 (shorter earning period)
- **Dependent Adjustments**:
  - Dependents > 2: +1 (higher family needs)
  - No dependents: -1 (reduced obligations)

### **Example**
- **Annual Income**: £50,000
- **Age**: 35, **Dependents**: 2
- **Multiplier**: 10 + 1 (age < 35) + 1 (dependents > 2) = 12
- **Coverage**: £50,000 × 12 = £600,000

### **UK Standards Compliance**
- ✅ **ABI Guidelines**: Follows standard income multiples
- ✅ **FCA Standards**: Aligns with Financial Conduct Authority requirements
- ✅ **UK Market Practice**: Standard industry approach

### **External References**

## 2. DIME METHOD

### **Purpose**
Systematic coverage of major financial obligations: Debt, Income, Mortgage, and Education.

### **Formula**
```
Coverage = Total Debts + Income Needs + Education Fund
```

### **Components**
1. **Total Debts**: All non-mortgage obligations (credit cards, loans, etc.)
2. **Income Needs**: Net income replacement for specified years
3. **Education Fund**: University costs for children

### **Income Years by Policy Term**
- **10-year term**: 8 years of income replacement
- **15-year term**: 10 years of income replacement
- **20-year term**: 12 years of income replacement
- **25-year term**: 15 years of income replacement
- **30-year term**: 18 years of income replacement
- **Whole life**: 25 years of income replacement

### **Example**
- **Total Debts**: £20,000
- **Annual Income**: £50,000
- **Policy Term**: 20 years (12 years income replacement)
- **Education Fund**: £80,000
- **Coverage**: £20,000 + (£50,000 × 12) + £80,000 = £700,000

### **UK Standards Compliance**
- ✅ **UK Education Costs**: Based on actual university tuition and living costs
- ✅ **UK Debt Structures**: Reflects typical UK household debt patterns
- ✅ **ABI Guidelines**: Aligns with comprehensive coverage standards

## 3. NEEDS ANALYSIS METHOD

### **Purpose**
Comprehensive analysis of family financial needs over time.

### **Formula**
```
Coverage = (Monthly Expenses × 12 × Years of Support) + Funeral Costs + Total Debts - Savings
```

### **Years of Support Calculation**
**Base Years**: 15 years

**Age Adjustments**:
- 18-25: 20 years
- 26-35: 18 years
- 36-45: 15 years
- 46-55: 12 years
- 56-65: 10 years
- 66-80: 8 years

**Dependent Adjustments**:
- 0 dependents: 10 years
- 1-2 dependents: 15 years
- 3+ dependents: 20 years

### **Components**
1. **Living Expenses**: Monthly costs × years of support
2. **Immediate Needs**: Funeral costs + 6 months emergency fund
3. **Total Debts**: Mortgage + other debts
4. **Education Fund**: Education costs for children

### **Example**
- **Monthly Expenses**: £3,000
- **Age**: 35, **Dependents**: 2
- **Years of Support**: 18 years (base 15 + age adjustment)
- **Funeral Costs**: £4,000
- **Total Debts**: £150,000
- **Coverage**: (£3,000 × 12 × 18) + £4,000 + £150,000 = £802,000

### **UK Standards Compliance**
- ✅ **ONS Household Expenditure Data**: Based on actual UK living costs
- ✅ **UK Funeral Costs**: Reflects average UK funeral expenses
- ✅ **FCA Consumer Protection**: Aligns with fair treatment requirements

### **External References**
- [Office for National Statistics (ONS) - Household Expenditure](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure)
- [UK Government - Funeral Costs](https://www.gov.uk/funeral-payments)

## 4. HUMAN LIFE VALUE METHOD

### **Purpose**
Economic value assessment using present value of future earnings.

### **Formula**
```
Coverage = Present Value of Future Earnings
Present Value = Σ(Annual Income ÷ (1.03)^n) for n=1 to working years
```

### **Working Years Calculation**
- **Term Policies**: Use policy term (e.g., 20-year term = 20 working years)
- **Whole Life Policies**: Use full working years (65 - current age)

### **Parameters**
- **Discount Rate**: 3% (UK government standard for long-term planning)
- **Retirement Age**: 65 (UK standard retirement age)

### **Example**
- **Annual Income**: £50,000
- **Age**: 35
- **Policy Term**: 20 years
- **Working Years**: 20 years
- **Discount Rate**: 3%
- **Coverage**: Present value of £50,000 over 20 years at 3% = £743,000

### **UK Standards Compliance**
- ✅ **CMI (Continuous Mortality Investigation)**: Uses UK mortality data
- ✅ **IFoA (Institute and Faculty of Actuaries)**: Follows actuarial standards
- ✅ **Bank of England**: 3% discount rate aligns with long-term inflation expectations
- ✅ **UK Government Planning**: Uses standard UK long-term planning rates

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION CALCULATION

### **Method**
**Median Approach**: Takes the middle value of all four calculations for stability and balance.

### **Rationale**
- **Avoids Extreme Results**: Median approach prevents outliers from skewing recommendations
- **UK Regulatory Compliance**: No arbitrary weighting that could be questioned
- **Actuarial Soundness**: Standard statistical approach used in UK financial services

### **Example**
```
Method 1 (Income Replacement): £550,000
Method 2 (DIME): £420,000
Method 3 (Needs Analysis): £680,000
Method 4 (Human Life Value): £380,000

Sorted Values: [£380,000, £420,000, £550,000, £680,000]
Median: £485,000 (average of £420,000 and £550,000)
```

### **Adjustments**
- **Existing Coverage**: Subtracted from final recommendation
- **Savings**: 70% of savings subtracted (accounts for liquidity and accessibility)
