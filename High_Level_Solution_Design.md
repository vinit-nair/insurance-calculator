## üß† Calculation Methods Explained

### The Four Methods We Use

1. **Income Replacement Method**
   - Calculates 10-12 times your annual income
   - Adjusts based on your age (younger people need more coverage)
   - Considers number of dependents

2. **DIME Method (Debt, Income, Mortgage, Education)**
   - Adds up all your debts
   - Includes future income needs
   - Accounts for children's education costs

3. **Comprehensive Needs Analysis**
   - Calculates ongoing living expenses
   - Includes emergency fund requirements
   - Considers specific family needs

4. **Human Life Value Method**
   - Calculates the economic value of your future earnings
   - Accounts for inflation over time
   - Uses standard UK discount rates

### How We Make the Final Recommendation
Instead of using complicated weighted averages, we simply take the middle value (median) of the four calculations. This approach is more stable and less prone to extreme results.
